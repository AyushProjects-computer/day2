üîç Tasks Performed
Generate Summary Statistics

Calculated key descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and quartiles for all numeric features.

Helped identify skewness, spread, and central tendency of variables.

Visualize Numeric Features

Plotted histograms to understand the distribution of each numeric column.

Created boxplots to detect the presence of outliers and the range of data.

Explore Feature Relationships

Used pairplots to visually inspect pairwise relationships between features.

Generated a correlation matrix heatmap to quantify and highlight linear relationships between numeric variables.

Draw Feature-Level Inferences

Based on visual patterns and statistical summaries, inferred basic relationships and characteristics of individual features.

These insights can inform feature engineering, data cleaning, or modeling strategies.
